	<p>Two of three members were sitting together in the library and we came to notice that there are so many people drinking coffee. It's genuinely amazing how coffee brings people together regardless of age, gender and race. Coffee is publicly loved and demanded at all times. We thought to convey this message through our little crafted video. We came up to make a slogan for the video "we are together" that speaks volumes about how coffee unites people all around the world helps to resonate sense of community accrose the countries and popularize the sleep deprived culture.</p>
